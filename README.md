# Blank-Ionic-Cordova-SQLite-test

Very simple Cordova-sqlite-storage test/demo app in Ionic, based on blank template

License: MIT

## Installation

- git clone
- within this directory do `ionic platform add <android|ios|??>`
- then you can use `ionic build` and/or `ionic run` to try this app on your emulator or device

## NOTES and TODO(s)

- This app uses the normal "window" alert function which is *not* supported by the Windows platform. TODO: use dialog plugin instead
- The necessary plugins were added with the `--save` option and tracked in `config.xml`. The plugins should be installed properly by `ionic platform add <android|ios|??>`.
